# The Event Loop

Visualizing the event loop is the best way to understand it. JS Tutor does not do this, and the debugger does not have a good visual for the event loop. To begin wrapping your head around the

1. Watch some videos about the event loop:
   - [Coding Nomad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YcMKYTZZvk) - short clear example
   - [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7sN1dDwcY) - restaurant analogy
   - [Loupe](http://latentflip.com/loupe) (and [Cloud Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xsvn6VUTwQ), an example in Loupe)
   - [In the Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0) another full talk with visuals.
2. Study some examples in JSV 9000 (the examples in this folder)
   - Studying them in [JSV 9000](https://www.jsv9000.app/) will help see the event loop in action
   - JSV 9000 is a visualization tool inspired by Loupe, but is more complete and reliable
3. Study the examples in `/isolate`
   - They will go deeper into timeouts, promises and async/await
   - `/isolate` examples can only be studied in the debugger, not JSV 9000
